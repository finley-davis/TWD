This repository provides the data and functions used for analysis in the Texas Well Depth project.

The data sources for all analyses are within the csvs file. These data were all extracted from the Texas Water Development Board's (TWDB) [well database](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/groundwater/data/gwdbrpt.asp) and then filtered toextract usbale values, which contain date, depth, and location.
